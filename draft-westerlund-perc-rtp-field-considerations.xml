    <abstract>
      <t>This draft discusses how the Privacy Enhanced RTP Conferencing
      solution will need consider the different RTP header fields in regards
      to both hop-by-hop and end-to-end security. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In the design of the PERC end-to-end security solution for RTP media
      streams there is need to carefully consider what properties the
      different fields have, their security implications and provide
      recommendations for how they are handled. This review needs to consider
      both hop-by-hop properties as well as the end-to-end security. </t>

      <t>The fields analysed are that of a regular RTP packet. This is to
      consider the impact of the information that exists normally in an
      centralized multi-party conference. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Definitions">
      <t>This document uses the following definitions:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Endpoint:">An RTP stream sending and/or receiving
          entity that is part of the end-to-end security context. </t>

          <t hangText="MDD:">Media Delivery Device - An RTP middlebox that
          operates according to any of the three possible <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update">RTP
          topologies</xref> that is possible in the PERC system:<list
              style="empty">
              <t>Transport Translator - Relay</t>

              <t>Switching RTP Mixer</t>

              <t>Selective Forwarding Middlebox (SFM)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t hangText="Third Party:">An entity that is neither an endpoint nor
          an MDD.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t></t>

      <section title="Connection Case">
        <t>This analys is based on a basic connectivity use cases, where a
        media stream sending endpoint (originating) sends one or more RTP
        streams to a MDD. That MDD is in its turn connected to another MDD
        (Cascaded) which further sends the media (when selecting to) from the
        originating endpoint to the receiving endpoint. This connection case
        is depicted in <xref target="fig-connection-case"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="RTP Packets Fields">
      <t>This section analyses each RTP packet field or part. </t>

      <section title="Version Field (V)">
        <t>As the solution is focused on RTP as defined by <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref> this field must be 2. This field needs to be
        hop-by-hop protected to prevent denial of service attacks by third
        parties. The version field does not require end-to-end protection as
        the MDD has more efficient denial of service attacks that it can
        perform on the endpoints, including not forwarding a single media
        packet/stream. </t>
