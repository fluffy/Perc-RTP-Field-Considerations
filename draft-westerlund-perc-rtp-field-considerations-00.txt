1.  Introduction

   In the design of the PERC end-to-end security solution for RTP media
   streams there is need to carefully consider what properties the
   different fields have, their security implications and provide
   recommendations for how they are handled.  This review needs to
   consider both hop-by-hop properties as well as the end-to-end
   security.

   The fields analysed are that of a regular RTP packet.  This is to
   consider the impact of the information that exists normally in an
   centralized multi-party conference.

2.  Definitions

   This document uses the following definitions:

   Endpoint:  An RTP stream sending and/or receiving entity that is part
      of the end-to-end security context.

   MDD:  Media Delivery Device - An RTP middlebox that operates
      according to any of the three possible RTP topologies

      [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update] that is possible in the
      PERC system:

         Transport Translator - Relay

         Switching RTP Mixer

         Selective Forwarding Middlebox (SFM)

   Third Party:  An entity that is neither an endpoint nor an MDD.

2.1.  Connection Case

   This analys is based on a basic connectivity use cases, where a media
   stream sending endpoint (originating) sends one or more RTP streams
   to a MDD.  That MDD is in its turn connected to another MDD
   (Cascaded) which further sends the media (when selecting to) from the
   originating endpoint to the receiving endpoint.  This connection case
   is depicted in Figure 1.

3.  RTP Packets Fields

   This section analyses each RTP packet field or part.  The anlysis for
   each field should answer the following questions:

      Can it be modified on path by an MDD?

      Does the receiving endpoint need the originating endpoints set
      value?

      Does it need end-to-end authentication?

      Does it need end-to-end confidentiality?

      Does it need hop-by-hop authentication?

      Does it need hob-by-hop confidentiality?

   Some general considerations apply.  Fields that are end-to-end
   authenticated is actually recommended to be hop-by-hop authenticated,
   even when there only are a end-to-end version of the field.  The
   reason for this is to detect modifications at the earliest instance
   and avoid wasting resource further down the path.

3.1.  Version Field (V)

   As the solution is focused on RTP as defined by [RFC3550] this field
   must be 2.  The field is not expected to be modified by an MDD.  The
   receiving endpoint will also assume that the originating endpoint
   used RTP (V=2).  Modification of this field should result in the
   packet being dropped by the receiving endpoint or MDD, independent if
   it is hop-by-hop authenticated.  The version field does not require
   end-to-end authentication as the MDD has more efficient denial of
   service attacks that it can perform on the endpoints, including not
   forwarding a single media packet/stream.  The field does not need to
   be confidentiality protected end-to-end as the MDD must know that it
   is RTP it receives.  The field may be hop-by-hop confidentiality
   protected as part of an attempt to hide that the packet stream is
   RTP, although packet analysis is likely to reveal that the streams
   are real-time media anyway.

3.2.  Padding Indicator bit (P)

   The padding bit is an indicator for the presence of the padding
   octets at the end of the RTP payload.  As further discussed in
   Padding Octets (Section 3.13) the padding is considered part of the
   payload and jointly protected with the payload.  The reason for this
   is that padding can help hide length variations in the payload that
   can leak information about the media content being carried [RFC6562].

   As the Payload and padding octets are end-to-end protected, the
   padding indicator can't be modified by the MDD, due to its inability
   to remove the padding octets.  For correct processing in the
   receiving endpoint the padding indicator needs to be correct.
   Therefore it should be end-to-end authenticated.  It could be end-to-
   end confidentiality protected.  The benefit of protecting it end-to-
   end would be that the MDD would not know if the end-to-end payload is
   padded or not.  Knowing if the payload is padded or not reduces the
   uncertainty for an attacker that attempts to perform content analysis
   based on payload length.  Because of that it would beneficial to
   protect the padding bit also hop-by-hop, if not already protected
   end-to-end.  The padding bit should be hop-by-hop authenticated to
   protect if end-to-end authentication is not used.
